# ðŸ”— DNS Configuration for Starteady.com

## Quick Reference for Domain Setup

### Required DNS Records for Vercel

When you add `starteady.com` to your Vercel project, you'll need to configure these DNS records at your domain registrar:

#### Option 1: Apex Domain + CNAME (Recommended)

**For starteady.com (Apex Domain):**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.19.19
TTL: 3600
```

**For www.starteady.com:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL: 3600
```

#### Option 2: Nameservers (Alternative)

If you prefer to use Vercel's nameservers:

**Replace your registrar's nameservers with:**
```
ns1.vercel-dns.com
ns2.vercel-dns.com
```

- Wait for propagation (can take up to 48 hours)

**Website Not Loading:**
- Verify Vercel deployment is successful
- Check that all files are in your GitHub repository
- Ensure domain is added to Vercel project

**HTTPS Issues:**

- If you see HTTPS errors, wait for certificate generation (usually 5-10 minutes)
